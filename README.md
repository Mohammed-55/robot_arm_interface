# robot_arm_interface

in this project, I made the robot arm interface by using Html, CSS, javascript, and PHP programming languages.
and the tasks that I must do:
1. Making a robot arm control interface by using HTML, CSS, and javascript.
2. Making a database for the robot arm.
3. Connect the control panel with the database.
4. Making a PHP page that can retrieve the information from the connected interface.

here I will write the user manual to show how to use this interface:

1. you can start it by using the robot_controller.php with the localhost(localhost/robot_controller.php).
2. after you start it you can see the sliders of every motor so you can change their value as you want.
3. if you click the(تشغيل وحفظ)button it will save the values on the database and turn on the robot.
4. if you click the(تشغيل وحفظ)button again it will turn off the robot.

for the last task, you can see the database information by using: localhost/info.php and it will show you the values of the motor and if it is off or on.
